# Summary

I have resumed my Final Year Project (TFG) after the Christmas break with some tasks left pending.

# Progress This Week

## Objective

This week, on the suggestion of my advisor to get more accustomed to training PilotNets, I aimed to train more networks. Specifically, I wanted to create one specialized in straight lines (the first one I created will now be used as the one specialized in curves, since it was trained on an "only curves" circuit). After that, I planned to train another one to identify whether I'm on a straight or curved part of the circuit and request the prediction from the appropriate network.

## Straight Net

I did not want to use the same dataset, as I wanted there to be a difference when using the straight line expert or the curve expert. To achieve this, I started by adding a condition to my neural pilot: if the angular speed was within a certain range, then we were on a straight line. In such cases, I manually established the speed instead of using the one predicted by the net. With this, I recorded another dataset of around 18,500 pairs of images and velocity commands and trained a 500-epoch net.

This took a while, but the results were worth it. I had a pilot that worked quite decently (the fastest yet) and accelerated significantly on curves.

## Decision Making

Not having yet implemented the decision-making neural net, we created a double neural pilot program that requested predictions from both networks and decided which to use based on the angular speeds. However, this wasn't exactly what I was looking for. Yes, the pilot performed better with the combination than with any of them alone. However, I knew that when the decision was wrong, it didn't matter much because even if the aggressive net was specialized in straight lines, it also knew how to turn... So I did it again, this time with even faster speeds in straight line situations.

## Too Aggressive Net

To save time, resources, and actually divide the job, I wanted the net to only learn how to go on a straight line. To do this, I generated another dataset in a similar way to the first one. However, this time, when preparing the data for training, I made a change: instead of balancing the data as before, I unbalanced it, taking only the data that had low angular speed, indicating that they were taken on a straight line.

With this, and knowing that going straight did not require a too large dataset, I soon had a "2aggressive" net.

## Graphing

Midway through the training of the first aggressive net, I realized I had not implemented a way to evaluate the dataset so it would end when it stopped evolving, nor did I have any graphs to show its progress. So, before the second training, I implemented it, and here is the graph of the 2aggressive net:

## Result and Pending Work

The result is a really fast pilot that detects when it's on a straight line and hands control over to an aggressive net, and when it's on a curve, it gives control to a safe net. This is the best pilot yet. However, we are not done. Right now, I am working on another net that decides which of them to use, a TripleNeuralPilot...
