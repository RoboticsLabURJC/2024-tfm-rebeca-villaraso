1. Continue adapting Ganav and DeepLabV3+ with the RELLIS-3D and RUGD datasets.
2. GitHub Pages cloning repository.
3. Create post for the current and the last 3 weeks work progress.

# Progress This Week

## 1. GANav and DeepLabV3+ on Rellis-3D 

Reproduction the GANav-offroad Github repository to perform semantic segmentation with the RELLIS-3D and RUGD datasets. RUGD have 24 semantic categories and RELLIS-3D have 20 semantic categories. The GANav-offroad repository reprocesses the two datasets to group the categories into 6 groups. To do this, new mask images are created with the new category ids and these are used for semantic segmentation. The repository was reproduced on a local computer and the code was executed without any modification.

The adaptation of Rellis-3D to DeepLabV3 could not be achieved, I still have problems adapting the data set to the network. 
The reasons are still being investigated.

## 2. Github Pages

The Github Pages template could be cloned.

## 3. Create post for the current and the last 3 weeks work progress.

The content from previous weeks could be updated in new posts.
